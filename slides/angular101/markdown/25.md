###How is the view simultaneously being updated while I pass input !?


This is called 2-way binding. Its one of those things angular is famous for.

One way binding is we setting the value on scope and that showing up in the *view*.

Two way binding is we setting the value from view and that showing up in the *model*

Here we acheive it using `ng-model`
