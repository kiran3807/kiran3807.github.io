###What is this ngRoute


* ngRoute is a module, which encapsulates the directives and services we need to implement routing 
  
  *PS : Notice that we have encapslated the calculator and number-to-word converter into separate modules.*

* We import ngRoute(along with our own custom modules) into `myApp` module

* We use `$route` service and `ng-view` directive 



###What is this *$routeProvider* ??


* angular has a *config* phase which executes before the app is executed. We can tap into the config phase
  using the `angular.module.config`  hook
  
* During the *config* phase you can configure the services before the singletons are instantiated




* Every service wether inbuilt or custom gets a provider corresponding to it. Not to be confused with the *provider recipie*
  
  For example, a service `xyz` will have a corresponding  `xyzProvider` created. 
  
* The corresponding *providers* can be injected into the `config` hook for configuring the services before they are instantiated.


* We use `$routeProvider` to configure the `$route` service.

* we use the `$routeProvider.when()` method to define the routes. We map the *URLs* with the corresponding views
