###{{ What are these strange brackets }}


* Those brackets evaluate *angular expressions*

* They are used to execute stuff in the context of the angular *scope* variable. More on *scopes* later on


They can also evaluate a sub-set of javascript expressions. Like 1 + 3 that we have seen in the previous example.
However Stuff like `if` and `else` wont work there( *ternary* operators will work there though )
