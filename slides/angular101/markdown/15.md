###Okay where do I write my logic now ?


* As hinted before, You write your code in *controllers*, *services* and *directives*

* Services contain buisness logic. Its basically resposible for generating the model

* Controllers have just enough logic to pass data from model to view

* Directives are what allow angular to extend the HTML. They are basically custom-html elements where you can package some functionality.
  Imagine of you can make custom-elements like the `video` tag
