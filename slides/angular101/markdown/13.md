###Hold on .... Modules ??


*Modules* are the heart and soul of angular. 

*Modules* are self contained peices of code that represent the logical partitioning of your application.

For example the calculator app were making contains two core functionalities :

* parsing and calculating the result of the expression given
* Displaying the said result.

Each of those functionalities can be packaged off in a *module*


In more practical terms, *modules* are where you register your *controllers*, *directives* and *services*. These are the places where you write your code. More on them later.

Once your functionality is packaged, you can freely mix and match *modules*. That is you can have a *module* import another *module* so on
and so forth, courtesy *Dependency injection*


The reason we use *modules* in angular is to avoid the problem of spaghetti code we have seen earlier.

The difference vis a vis *The revealing module pattern* we have seen earlier  is that modules are :

* Integrated with **angular life-cycle** (*change detection, compile et al*)
* Can be injected using DI
