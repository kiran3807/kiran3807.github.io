###However all is not well 


* The code is all over the place. The DOM manipulation buisness logic are mixed together in one big spaghetti code

* All though we acheive one-way binding via event handlers, We are forced to write code in call-backs. That can quickly 
  Escalate into a call-back hell

* Also inorder to acheive two way binding we will have to explicitly 
  Call two functions

* It is hard to do routing and by extension make SPA's using jQuery only.
