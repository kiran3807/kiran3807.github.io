###Shoudn't the buttons be clickable ?


Yes they should. For that we have another inbuilt directive, `ng-click`

It takes a function as an argument which would be executed when `click` event is detected

[Here is an example with `ng-click` and `ng-repeat`](https://jsfiddle.net/Kiran3807/cf1pxuzt/)
