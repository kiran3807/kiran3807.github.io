###More on controllers :


[This is how you define a controller](https://jsfiddle.net/Kiran3807/7f30t45t/)

Whats happening in here ?

We registered a new *controller* in the *module* and bound the controller to *scope* using `ng-controller` directive

I remember saying that controllers help connect *model* to *view*. Well it does that with the help of the *scope*.
