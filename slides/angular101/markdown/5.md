###The wish list 


If santa could build frameworks, this is what we would like for christmas

A framework that would :

* Allow us to logically split our app into a *model*, *view* and a *controller*
* Allow us to use *Dependency injection(TM)* to decouple components of our app
* Allow us to write our view logic in a *declarative way*, thus letting us focus on the real meat of our app(buisness logic)

Bonus :
* Allow us to structure our app as *Single page application* (SPA)
