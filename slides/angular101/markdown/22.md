###I see that we have injected something else....


* We have injected a *service* into the *controller*. It holds the logic to add the terms

* *Services* are basically singleton objects that live as long as the application exists

* Any code that needs to be shared across the app, *service* is the place to go

* *Scopes* and *controllers* may come and go but services are for ever( atleast untill the application lives that is )




###How to create services


angular offers us 3 *recipies* to create a service

* *factory recipie*

* *service recipie*

* *provider recipie*



Dont get confused by the *service recipie* to create a *service*  !
  
In the current context by *service* I mean the singleton created by the framework

when referring to the recipie, it will be explicitly called the *service recipie*
  
[Check this example demonstrating the creation of services using all 3 recipies](https://jsfiddle.net/Kiran3807/ohf8c7kp/)


* The *Factory recipie* return an object that is used as the singleton. That is it serves as a singleton object factory

* In the *Service recipie*, the function passed to it functions as a constructor for the singlton

* The *Provider recipie*  returns an object which contains a `$get` property, which is mapped to a function that serves as a singleton factory
