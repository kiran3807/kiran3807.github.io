###I see that we have injected something else....


* We have injected a *service* into the *controller*. It holds the logic to add the terms

* *Services* are basically singleton objects that live as long as the application exists

* Any code that needs to be shared across the app, *service* is the place to go

* *Scopes* and *controllers* may come and go but services are for ever( atleast untill the application lives that is )
