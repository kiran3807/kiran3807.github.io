###What is this scope again


* It is by attaching *POJOs* to scope that you get to access them in the view

* *Scope* helps attach *model* to a certain portion of the view

* So basically *scope* is passed around as a dependency wherever you need to show something you calculated eg like in *controllers*,
  *directives* and so on.
