##Final remarks


There is a lot that we have covered. However there is a lot that we **haven't** covered

* Change detection ( *digest cycle* )

* Events in angular

* *directive* compilation

* `$injector` and `$provide`

* *scope* heirarchy and inheritance

These concepts explain the magic behind the angular. Do give them a look !
