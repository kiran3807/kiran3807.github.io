the directive function must return an object called the *directive definition object(ddo)*.

The *ddo* contains attributes that can modify the behaviour of the directive.

In the previous example we have used the attributes `template`,`scope` and `controller` along with `link`




The `template` property allows us the associate custom HTML with our *directive*

The `scope` property allows us to define the wether the *directive* is associated with its own scope or inherits/is a child of
the parent scope

`controller` associates a predefined controller to manage the functionality of the *directive*.

`link` is associated with a function that allows us to further DOM manipulation of the *directive*
