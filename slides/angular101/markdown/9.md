###You said something about SPA's


* Single page applications are basically apps that render new content without a server round trip

* It uses client side routing to enable the same

* It makes the UX smooth and makes one feel as if they are interacting with app instead of an web-site



###What is client side routing ?


* With the advent of *AJAX*, we no longer have to re-load the page to fetch new content. That is we dont have to navigate
  to a new URL for new content

* However that makes state maintainance a problem. We can no longer rely on the *URL* to indicate current state of the SPA.

* God forbid if we need to re-create a specific state of the app. Without the *URL* to guide us we are forced to re-trace our steps.
  Much like a game without saves.



* Manipulating the hash anchors in the *URL* allows us to change the URL without causing full page reloads. 
* *HTML 5 pushState API* allows us the hash *URL's* to be navigable using the browsers front and back buttons

* Thus we can **simulate routing at the front end** without sending a single call to the backend
