			    <p>Learning about typescript 
	                <code>modules</code> took a quite a bit of google fu. Also it does not help the fact that there more than 2 ways to do the same thing. So without further ado, lets dive in
                </p>
                <h3>Namespaces :</h3>
                <p>At the very beginning there was no modules and eveything was in global name space. Then the developers came up with revealing module pattern and saw it was good.</p>
                <p>//1-12</p>
                <p>This is exactly what typescript namespaces( earlier known as internal modules) do</p>
                <p>//13-22</p>
                <p>Here the functions
	                <code> batman</code> and 
	                <code>joker</code> exist in the namespace
	                <code> Gotham</code>. So if I want to use them, I do this :
                </p>
                <p>//23-24</p>
                <p>Notice that we have exported the function 
	                <code>batman</code> under the name 
	                <code>darkKnight</code> and 
	                <code>joker</code> under 
	                <code>clownPrince.</code> There is one caveat here, we cannot use the export keyword this way :
                </p>
                <p>//25-32</p>
                <p>It will throw an error which in effect says&nbsp; that export can only be used infront of declarations or statements.</p>
                <p>At times importing a class/object with a particularly long name from a namespace can be quite bothersome , especially when it is commonly used.</p>
                <p>//34-40</p>
                <p>there we can use the 
	                <code>import=</code> syntax to make our jobs easier
                </p>
                <p>//41-42</p>
                <h3>Modules :</h3>
                <p>Although namespaces solved the problem of re-use of variable name, we still have to include the javascript files in the 
	                <code>script</code> tags and include them in the correct order. For example in 
	                <code>angular.js</code> if we wish to use 
	                <code>jquery</code> along with it, we need to include 
	                <code>jquery</code> before 
	                <code>angular</code>. It may be trivial for small projects but it will cause headaches as the project grows.
                </p>
                <p>To solve the problem the 
	                <code>CommonJs</code> specification was introduced. It contained the specs which specified as to how to implement the module and dependency managment system. It has been partially implemented by 
	                <code>node.js</code>
                </p>
                <p>Earlier on there were a bunch of developers who were not satisfied with the server centric focus in the 
	                <code>CommonJs</code> specification. especially on the synchronous loading of modules. In the browsers environment were user experience is paramount, asynchronous was the way to go.
                </p>
                <p>So the 
	                <code>amd</code> specefication came to be. 
	                <code>require.js</code> is one example of 
	                <code>amd</code> spec implementation.
                </p>
                <p>Come 
	                <code>ECMAscript 2015</code> the language has finnaly provided inbuilt support to the modules.It has support for both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation. Although none of the major runtimes like 
	                <code>spider-monkey</code> or 
	                <code>v8</code> have yet to implement to the module loading specs however since its integrated with the language in future the run-times can let you pick the mode of operation. For now we have to depend on external module loaders such as 
	                <code>system.js</code>
                </p>
                <p>So the module system implemented in typescript is syntactically similar to 
	                <code>ECMAscript 2015. </code>However as typescript compiler emits javascript in the end, its module system does not actually load any javascript at run time. that is left to module loaders which can be specified using the compilation this way : 
	                <code>tsc -m amd myFile.tsc</code> or
	                <code> tsc -m commonjs myFile.tsc</code> . 
	                <code>
		                <br />
	                </code>
                </p>
                <p>In typescript any file that has the keyword 
	                <code>export</code> in it, or begins with
	                <code> import</code> is a module by default a module. The name of the module is same as the name of the file. For example
                </p>

                <p>We can use the above module the follow way</p>

                <h3>The export statement :</h3>
                <p>There are a bunch of ways you can export variables in typescript. We have already seen one way to do it, by simply prefacing a declaration with 
	                <code>export</code>. The other way is to export the variable after the variable/object is declared by using the curly brace syntax
                </p>
                <p>//article_2 42-45</p>
                <p>You can also use the curly braces to export the variable with a different alias</p>
                <p>//article_2 46-49</p>
                <p>We use the curly braces in the import as well to specify that we are importing individual components from the module</p>
                <p>//article_2 64-65</p>
                <p>Then you have the 
	                <code>default export</code>. Only one 
	                <code>default export</code> is allowed per file. This is used so that the only variable from the module is visible outside. all the logic of the module is encapsulated within. This is used in conjuction with 
	                <code>import xyv from './myModule'</code> syntax
                </p>
                <p>//article_2 50-63</p>
                <p>Finnaly we have the 
	                <code>export= syntax</code> which is used with
	                <code> require</code> keyword in the import. It has nothing to do with what kind of module loader the emmited javascript will use. It is primarily there to model the 
	                <code>commonjs</code> and 
	                <code>amd</code> workflows
                </p>
                <p>//article_2 66-73</p>
                <h3>The import keyword :</h3>
                <p>There are two types of imports in typescript, 
	                <em>relative</em> and 
	                <em>non-relative</em>. any import written like this :
                </p>
                <pre>import { someComponent } from './someModule';</pre>
                <p>is a relative import. Any import of this form :</p>
                <pre>import ( component ) from 'myModule';</pre>
                <p>is a 
	                <em>non-relative import</em>. Ultimately both relative and non-relative imports resolve to typescript files. 
	                <em>Relative imports</em> directly resolve to the typescript files pointed by the 
	                <code>string</code> after the 
	                <code>from</code> keyword and looked up in the current folder. However the way 
	                <em>non-relative</em> imports are resolved is a little more involved. They are looked up in special folders called 
	                <em>node_modules</em>
                </p>
                <p>Also there are two module resolution strategies, 
	                <em>classic</em> and 
	                <em>node</em>. classic is present mostly for backward compatibility with previous versions of type script . 
	                <em>Node</em> is now the default module resolution strategy.
                </p>
                <p>The exact details of how modules are resolved can be found 
	                <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Module%20Resolution.md#user-content-module-resolution-strategies">here</a>. However in short this is how 
	                <em>non-relative</em> module resolution is done using 
	                <em>node</em> strategy :
                </p>
                <pre>import { component } from 'myModule';</pre>
                <ol>
	                <li>It looks for the file 
		                <code>myModule.ts</code> or 
		                <code>myModule.tsx</code> or 
		                <code>myModule.d.ts</code> in the&nbsp; folder 
		                <em>node_modules </em>in the directory which contains the current typescript file.
	                </li>
	                <li>It looks for file 
		                <code>package.json</code> and searches whether it has the property 
		                <code>typings</code>. If it does it checks wether the 
		                <code>typings</code> property is set to
		                <code> myModule</code>.
	                </li>
	                <li>It looks for a file named 
		                <em>index.js</em> in the current folder and if found that is what the 
		                <code>myModule</code> maps to.
	                </li>
	                <li>It then looks for folder 
		                <em>node_modules</em> in one level higher than the 
		                <em>current</em> directory, that is the directory which contains the typescript file that has the above mentioned
		                <code> import</code> statement. It frepeats the steps 1 to 3.
	                </li>
	                <li>if still not found it goes up the one level higher and searches for 
		                <em>node_modules</em> folder again , following the same steps, untill it reaches the root.
	                </li>
	                <li>if still not found it throws an error.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Final words :</h3>
                <p>One major shift in thinking that is needed while working with typescript is that you treat your 
	                <code>*.ts</code> files as
	                <strong> the source</strong> files. The emmited javascript is for all practical purposes to be treated as byte-code that is run on the browser/node.
                </p>
                <p>For example the analogue to 
	                <code>*.java</code> files would be the 
	                <code>*.ts</code> files and
	                <code> javac</code>'s role is taken up by 
	                <code>tsc</code>. The emmited javascript is equivalent to the
	                <em> JVM byte code</em>.
                </p>
