    <h1>Vrtraharnam.</h1>
    <h2>The story of Indra and the dragon.</h2>
    <h3><Canto 1 : Theogony - Dawn of the gods</h3>
    
    <p>Before the <em>Suryavansh</em> did enjoy it's noon.<br>
    Before the time men gazed upon the moon.</p>
    
    <p>Before the time the <em>Ashvins</em> rode across the sky<br>
    Before the dawn of truth and t’was veiled by lie</p>
    
    <p>The seed of creation emerged in primal mind<br>
    Came forth the cosmic ocean from the void asthough t'was seined</p>
    
    <p>With being, non being asunder so came<br>
    The eternal <em>Rtam</em>, rendering cosmos tame</p>
    
    <p>A ruler needs laws to claim his divine right<br>
    So unto laws a ruler, to last the chaotic night</p>
    
    <p>And so what was conceived was bound inexorably<br>
    To <em>Rtam</em>, on whose worship, rested reality</p>
    
    <p>As <em>Atman</em> animates, pouring life in body<br>
    To fill the void with life was kindled <em>Agni</em>.</p>
    
    <p>As sheep are tended, under shepherd’s gaze<br>
    So did <em>Rtam</em> demand a wick to succour it’s blaze</p>
    
    <p>In being did come <em>Varuna-Purusha</em>;<br>
    The lord of cosmic ocean, the <em>asura Varuna</em></p>
    
    <p>Envelopes all with countenance most grim<br>
    With <em>Purusha</em>, blessed with multitude of limb.</p>
    
    <p>As <em>Varuna</em> churned the cosmic water.<br>
    arise did earth and sky like cream and butter.</p>
    
    <p>Together in connate embrace, beckoning<br>
    Of <em>Rtam</em> did come their fated existence calling</p>
    
    <p>Subject to <em>Rtam</em> cosmic law was indeed<br>
    its whim’s did many-faced <em>Purusha’s</em> doom itself cede</p>
    
    <p>A <em>yajna</em> was deemed, very first of its kind<br>
    With <em>Agni</em> as priest, had <em>Varuna</em> consigned</p>
    
    <p><em>Purusha</em> as oblation, himself celebrant<br>
    From sacred fire came <em>devas</em>, ever radiant.</p>
    
    <p>Amongst, one rides his chariot forth so luminous<br>
    from east to west, on seven steeds so numinous</p>
    
    <p>Another god so bears a hammer over anvil<br>
    Celestial smith, who taught all crafts civil</p>
    
    <p>The host had twelve brothers, keepers of time<br>
    <em>Aditya</em>s, <em>Surya</em>'s allies , <em>Mithra</em> their prime</p>
    
    <p>The <em>Yagic</em> flames seared night endless<br>
    It’s light was <em>Visnu</em>, bane of entropy’s darkeness</p>
    
    <p>As <em>Agni</em> chanted, flames emblazed upon the altar<br>
    It’s crackling were <em>Maruts</em>, their laughter was thunder</p>
    
    <p>From the smoke of yajna, arose that girder <em>Vayu</em>, of life<br>
    Ally of <em>Agni</em>, breath which keeps us alive</p>
    
    <p>With the oblation burnt, libations spent<br>
    Emerged from embers Lo! both beast and men</p>
    
    <p>With <em>Maha-Yajna</em> complete and <em>Rtam</em> sated<br>
    The wistful <em>Varuna</em> sought exile from world he created.</p>
    
    <p>To pay with penance most severe for <em>Purusha’s</em> demise<br>
    Along with bones, he left until is paid the price</p>
    
    <p>To make a home for men and gods upon the high<br>
    <em>Trivikrama</em>(Visnu) sowed discord between the earth and sky</p>
    
    <p>Estranging them, he raised the land from ocean<br>
    Rejoice did men and beast for over <em>Danu</em>, was <em>Bhumi</em> chosen</p>
    
    <p><em>Visnu</em> did pierce the bust of <em>Danu</em>, to raise<br>
    The mount <em>Sumeru</em>, thus setting her ablaze</p>
    
    <p>With vengeance. Heavens shall be upon the peak<br>
    decreed astutely <em>Visnu</em>, <em>Tvastr</em> the smith beyond critique</p>
    
    <p>Did fashion heavens whence the <em>Devas</em> reside<br>
    And such was will of <em>Rtam</em> even gods so must abide</p>
